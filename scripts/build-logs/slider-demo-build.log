error during build:
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "mr-slider" from "C:/Users/danha/source/repos/Web/Canvas/Basic/NewFunckingTry/apps/slider-demo/index.html?html-proxy&index=0.js".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
